Current tasks:

Known fragile points of system:
- in sheet processor there is a value stored as the expected column header for the id column
  which should appear in the case of data being re-submitted with error corrections
    - this value cannot appear in the first column of the data
    - currently this header is assumed to be something like record_id
    - might want to de-couple this from the rest of the library, as many use cases
      will not need a plain text upload history, where the data is validated on the
      client side, or with immediate feedback from the server
        - its not very coupled to the system as is
        - there is the duplicate check that is worked into the value processing system
          but this could be useful for other applications
